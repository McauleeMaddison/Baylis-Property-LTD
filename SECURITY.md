Security policy
===============

Report security vulnerabilities to the project owner. Do not create public issues for vulnerabilities. Provide a secure contact email or use GitHub's vulnerability reporting.

If you have found a security issue:

1. Do not publish the issue publicly.
2. Send an email to the project maintainer with details and reproduction steps.
3. Allow maintainers time to triage and release a fix.
